This was a coding project I made that takes hot posts from Reddit as well as different background videos from YouTube (such as Minecraft parkour), and automatically creates a short video from them. This automates the work of video editing, and can be used in content-farm style TikTok and YouTube Shorts accounts.

Unfortunately, since Reddit has recently monetized its API, the media-sourcing portion of the script no longer works :(
